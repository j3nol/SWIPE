# swipe
Cross platform mobile application for job hunting

## Overview
React Native app that allows users to find job postings in the nearby area through the Github Jobs API. 
1. Search: Scroll around on the map to find a desired location- click search
2. Swipe: Swipe right on jobs you like and left on ones you dislike
3. Apply: Jobs you have liked will appear in the 'review' tab- click apply to be taken to the listing

Note: Currently location is set in the US by default as there are no New Zealand jobs listed on GitHub.

The original version of the app is based on Stephen Grider's [Advanced React Native course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-native-advanced/). I have since redesigned it to take advantage of React's latest features such as hooks and the Context API. The new version has also been adapted to be more beginner friendly and I have used it to run a 3 part workshop for UoA's Developer's Society which can be found [here](https://github.com/devsuoa/swipe-app-final/).
